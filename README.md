## Overview
This project is a data-driven election website that dynamically displays election results from two different years using multiple types of data visualizations.

I designed the relational database and implemented the Java back-end services using Spring Boot, focusing on clean and maintainable code. On the front-end, I built pages in Vue.js using reusable components and integrated them with REST APIs.

I especially enjoyed working on this project because Spring Boot and Vue.js make it possible to build modern-looking applications with a clear structure. Using Swagger to document the APIs also made collaboration easier and helped keep the back-end and front-end well aligned.

## Notes
This project is kept as part of my personal portfolio to showcase my development approach, technical skills, and learning process.
