## Overview
This project is a text-based game built with Lit and TypeScript, where I explored object-oriented programming concepts and component-based UI design.

I was responsible for creating the “garden chamber” room, which gave me a lot of creative freedom. I experimented with basic TypeScript syntax and Lit integrations, such as dynamically changing images based on the player, their inventory, and the actions they took.

One of the things I enjoyed most about this project was being able to experiment freely — even adding slightly silly outcomes (like unexpectedly killing the player) while still focusing on clean logic and structure. It was a fun way to learn how gameplay logic and UI updates work together.
