    <p>In the Netherlands, elections are held regularly to allow citizens to choose their representatives in government.
      Dutch nationals aged 18 and older are eligible to vote. Elections for the House of Representatives (Tweede
      Kamer)—the most influential body in Dutch politics—are held every four years, unless a government collapses
      earlier.
      In these elections, voters decide which political parties will occupy the 150 seats in Parliament, which in turn
      shapes the future direction of Dutch laws, policies, and leadership.</p>

      Voting in the Netherlands is easy and accessible. Eligible voters receive a voting pass (stempas) by mail, along
      with information about where their nearest polling station is located. On election day, voters simply bring their
      ID and voting pass to the polling station, where they fill out a paper ballot in a private booth. The process is
      quick and transparent. After voting ends, all ballots are counted by hand, and the results are carefully verified
      to ensure a fair outcome. You can also authorize someone to vote on your behalf using a proxy (machtiging), if
      you’re unable to go in person.</p>

      The Netherlands has a parliamentary democracy with a constitutional monarchy, meaning the King has a ceremonial
      role while elected officials handle the country's governance. The Dutch Parliament, or Staten-Generaal, is made up
      of two chambers: the Senate (Eerste Kamer) and the House of Representatives (Tweede Kamer). The House of
      Representatives holds the most power—it debates laws, controls the budget, and monitors the Cabinet. The chamber
      consists of 150 seats, which are shown in the image above, often arranged in a semicircle representing each
      party’s share of seats.

      After elections, political parties begin negotiations to form a coalition government—since no single party usually
      wins a majority. The parties that form a majority coalition agree on a policy plan and appoint ministers,
      including the Prime Minister, to lead the country. The number of seats each party holds determines its influence
      in shaping government policy. This collaborative system means that Dutch governments are often a balance of
      different political viewpoints, which encourages compromise and dialogue in decision-making.
